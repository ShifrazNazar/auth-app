# Getting Started with React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and is configured with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

## Installation

1. **Change Directory to frontend:**

    ```bash
    cd /frontend
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Start the development server:**

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the application.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

It will copy all the configuration files and transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point, you’re on your own.

You don’t have to use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Configuration

### TypeScript

This project uses TypeScript for type checking. For more information on TypeScript in Create React App, see [TypeScript and Create React App](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/adding-typescript).

### Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS is used for styling. You can find the configuration in `tailwind.config.js` and additional styling instructions in the [Tailwind CSS documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs).
